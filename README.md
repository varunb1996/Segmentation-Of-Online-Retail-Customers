INTRODUCTION

Businesses worldwide continue to expand rapidly, driven by technological advancements that provide access to broader markets and larger customer bases. Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into distinct groups based on shared characteristics and behaviors.

This project focuses on identifying key customer segments within a transnational dataset for a UK-based online retail company. The insights gained will enable the business to better understand its customers and tailor strategies to meet their diverse needs.


PROBLEM STATEMENT

This project focuses on identifying major customer segments within a transnational dataset that records all transactions between December 1, 2010, and December 9, 2011 for a UK-based, registered non-store online retailer. The company primarily sells unique, all-occasion gifts, and a significant portion of its customer base consists of wholesalers.


WHY CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION?

Variations in customer behavior, demographics, and geographic factors enable businesses to classify customers into distinct groups. Understanding these segments provides valuable insights that support:

Targeted Marketing – delivering personalized campaigns to specific customer groups

Enhanced Client Understanding – gaining deeper knowledge of customer needs and preferences

Optimal Product Placement – positioning products effectively to match segment demand

Revenue Growth – driving profitability through tailored strategies for each segment


RFM MODEL TO FIND THE CUSTOMER VALUE

The RFM model is a widely used approach in retail customer segmentation, particularly when only transactional data is available. RFM represents three key dimensions:

Recency – how recently a customer made a purchase

Frequency – how often a customer makes purchases

Monetary Value – how much a customer spends

By combining these attributes, businesses can assign a quantitative score to each customer. For example, a customer who has purchased recently, buys frequently, and spends significantly can be classified as a high-value customer.


METHODOLOGY

Data Inspection, EDA, Data preparation, Create RFM model, Validating using clustering models


RESULTS

Descriptive Analysis
Exploration of the Online Customer Segmentation dataset revealed the following insights:

Data Quality: Missing and duplicate values were identified.

Geography: The majority of purchases originated from the United Kingdom.

Day of Purchase: Most transactions occurred on Thursday, Wednesday, and Tuesday.

Seasonality: Peak purchasing activity was observed in November, October, and December, while the lowest activity occurred in April, January, and February.

Time of Day: Customers predominantly made purchases during the afternoon hours.

Using Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis, customers were segmented into distinct clusters. Application of various clustering algorithms determined that the optimal number of clusters is three.

From a business perspective, these clusters highlight different customer behaviors. By tailoring services and strategies to each segment, the company can enhance customer satisfaction, improve engagement, and drive overall business growth.
